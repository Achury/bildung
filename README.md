# Die Buildung

Welcome to the null industries training project.

This content is intended to guys and girls desiring to learn how to build web applications the right way using python.
We believe in pragmatic learning and focus on web development. In deed the goal is to train yourself building high scalable REST-like API's and javascript clients using MVC frameworks.

Specifically you will learn about django, tastypie, backbone.js, coffeescript, less, PaaS deployment,
Scrum like life cycles, code management using git and github.


This is the first and very early version of this content and we hope to improve this with your help.
So you know just fork it!

By now there is no much content here, this is a work in progress you can keep watching for upgrades ;)
and yeah we maybe end writing a book or something, if feel interested please let me know, it could be a funny way to share the knowledge :)

Today this is just a guide with references to external documentation.

## Table of contents:

01. Python and the batteries included
02. Git and github pragmatic concepts
03. The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines
031. The polls tutorial
04. Web services: RESTful? Who cares?
05. Rest riding a python eating a tasty pie.
06. Javascript MVC's and the backbone.
07. Deploying to the nuage PaaS.
08. Testing basics and the precommit hook.
09. CI using Jenkins.
10. List growing.


Feel free to skip sections just be sure you are having fun ;)

## 00 - Warning

Ok this section is to warn you: This is very in progress and by now just try this:

1. Fork this repository to your github account. (Using the github web fork button!)
2. Clone it to your local machine (git clone git@github.com....)
3. Create a virtualenv for your project
4. Start the django poll tutorial from [The django project][1]
5. Make your initial commit and push to your repo
6. Make a pull request to the original repository (this)
7. Lets start the code review there :) A null guy will check your code and try to help
8. Once you finish with the poll example. Start building a RESTful API for the poll system using Tastypie
9. When feel ready lets build an API client using backbone.js
10. Now that you have the idea try to add a new feature the the poll system but this time code the client using coffeescript and less

NOTE: You can use the following sections to find helpful documentation and recommendations on each of the above steps.

``` 
Also if you are in Medell√≠n don't loose /dev/med/ a great event where you can learn from rockstars. (http://devmed.sh)
```

## 01 - Python and the batteries included

If you want to learn python [Dive in to python](http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html) is your friend.
Just try to not spend too much diving and move on real content, a real project with deadlines.

Make a self commitment to finish some little stuff, write the goal down and share it with a friend this little pressure can help sometimes.


## 02 - Git and github

There are plenty of git cheat sheets and guides. If you are new just try to keep it simple,
go with simple concepts like creating commits, cloning repositories, remotes or pulling and pushing to remotes.
Git is a very powerful tool with a lot of things to learn about dont try to get them all at once jsut let the solutions come when the problems arrive ;)
